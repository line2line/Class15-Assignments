Let us find the difference between Maven and Gradle

Maven Defnition
Maven is a popular open-source build tool that the Apache Group developed for building, publishing, and deploying many projects. Maven is written in Java and is used to create projects written in C++, Scala, Ruby, etc... The tool is used to build and manage any Java-based project.
 
Gradle Definition
Gradle is an open-source build automation tool flexible enough to build almost any type of software. Gradle makes few assumptions about what youâ€™re trying to build or how to build it. This makes Gradle particularly flexible.
